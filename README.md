# projectTelescope2
Project for my former ESS class. Will hopefully make the IA a lot easier, and allow for wider usage of UnData by the class in general

# Why
I struggled a great deal to complete my ESS IA during sophomore year. My whole premise ended up being useless. While I was still able to get credit for it,
I still would have preferred to know that somewhere closer to the beginning. Hopefully, the ESS students of the future will learn from my mistakes, and thus, avoid them
